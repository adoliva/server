        <h3> Introduction </h3>
        <p>
            This is meant to be a blog post about my experiences writing C socket code and learning frontend with html. I will attempt to update This
              every week but I am a full time student. The website will be smarter once I get to updating it.
        </p>
        <p>Week 2 of learning html. Wrote all the backend last week with C sockets. This server is hosted on my Raspberry Pi 3B in my college dorm.
            I'll embbed an image once I get the chance.

        <h4> Server </h4>
        <p> 
            I intend to make all of my code Open-Source. Any comments are accepted. The server will be compiled and ran on the server.c and server.h 
              provided. I should also mention that I wrote this server in approximately 2 weeks. Because of this, it's only ran on http right now. I 
              will add HTTPS support at a later date. Use http://100.64.18.186/code/{date}/server.* for the source code. Remember to let your browser know
              what you want. These are just code files. As seen in the code, I send back 'text/x-c' for both of these.
        </p>
        <p>
            Like I said everything will be Open-Source. Feel free to use this template wherever. 
            
            Here is the tree of the program. Everything with a filetype is a file, everything else is a directory except for server in the root. 
              That is the exectuable.

        <h5> Issues </h5>
        <p> 
            Interestingly, I had an easy time setting up the server I wrote with only minor issues. For multiple clients I use a multiplexing I/O system
              with the select() function. select() tracks file descriptors and alerts the OS of any new activity. Right now, it is only active for up to 10 
              clients at a time. This is because the Pi has 1GB of RAM and im worried about it using too much memory. 
        </p>
        <h5> HTTPS </h5>
        <p>
            Like stated, I do plan on adding HTTPS support. I have seen the request in the header 'Upgrade: 1'. This, of course, is the client trying to tell 
              me that they want to use HTTPS. I'm not sure how to handle that. The server itself will be easy enough to write and run with SSL, but how will
              I redirect the client to two seperate executables? I can forward the request somehow? This is only a thought and will be included later.
        </p>
        <h5> Magik </h5>
        <p>
            I think this is right. Magik, I think, is a tool that I can use for determining the file type. For now, I keep track of all my webpages so I don't 
              need to use Magik. I will use it one day but not now - the file-types are simple. 
        </p>
        <h5> Unsupported Methods </h5>
        <p>
            This server only supports GET and HEAD requests. This is because I'm not sure how to handle POST or PUT requests yet. OPTIONS i may add as well. Not
              sure how or when.  
        </p>
        <h5> Favicon </h5>
        <p>
            For those of you that don't know, favicons are those tiny images that appear in the upper left of the tab. Yes, your browser makes a seperate request
              for each one of those. When I say these are a pain, they are. They only support a few different filetypes. I use svg as a filetype for mine although 
              I have no idea if that's usual. I look at the Accept: header from my browser and it asks for it. It's not so much the complexity of the favicon 
              request, it's the sparcity of the requests. Your browser will cache the webpage but if you refresh the page, it'll send a request for the page. Guess
              what it won't send a request for? Thats right, the favicon. Good luck debugging further on that future me. :(
        </p>
        <h5> Note </h5>
        <p>
            I'll make it prettier for the next entry but those are my comments this week. :) <br>
