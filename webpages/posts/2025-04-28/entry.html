        <h3> Caching </h3>
        <p>
            I've been busy this week. I added caching this week. I wanted to have a few requirements for caching. <br>

            My idea was to create a Binary Search Tree that hashes the file contents AT STARTUP to save time during server runtime. <br>
              This worked until I remembered how a BST works, {key, value} pairs. You have to have a value to lookup to get the key. 
              In order to get the hash, I had to re-hash the entire file to see if it was changed mid-request. This worked, but it was slow. <br>

            So what I did instead was hash the path names so that I'm not reading the entire file. This just takes values of the string and hashes
              them together to make a unique value. So, the key is the path name and the value is the unique hashed value.

        <h5> Issues </h5>
        <p> 
            I had a few issues with caching as it came up. I think the biggest thing was just remembering how caching works because it's been a year. <br>

            Besides that, I had a few issues with logic flow as well. I fixed an issue with the server recieving cient requests but not processing them
              but it's back. I'll look into it next week. <br>

            Also haven't figured out how to free the tree yet. Seems easy enough but I need to do it. 
        </p>

        <h5> HTTPS </h5>
        <p> 
            Figured out how to do HTTPS. It didn't cross my mind that I could just open a new socket for port 443. Don't know why that didn't cross my mind 
              but I can just open a new socket and accept connections with a new HTTPS file descriptor. It is so much easier than what I was thinking of doing
              which was to open a new executable. 

            Going to add a new data type in the client structure but that's okay I'll finish a few other things first.
