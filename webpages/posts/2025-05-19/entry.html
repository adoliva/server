        <h3> HTTPS </h3>
        <p>
            I've had a lot of thoughts about HTTPS recently. Implementing it is easy, implementing it the RIGHT way is difficult. 
              I thought that I'd just implement it and go back later if I find a better way to do it. <br><br>

            Alright let's get into it. Originally my http flow was <br>
            <pre>
                Initial Setup
                Create array of ints to hold sockets
                Create fd_set objects
                Check for activity with select()
                  Set fd_set object
                For every client
                  Check for fd_set objects
                    Process Client
            </pre>

            For the most part, this works well. It works for a single socket watching for http connections. Adding a https socket in there complicates
              things pretty bad. This is the primitive implentation. <br> <br>

            <pre>
                HTTP Initial Setup 
                HTTPS Initial Setup 
                Create HTTP array of ints to hold sockets
                Create HTTPS array of ints to hold sockets
                Create fd_set objects for HTTP
                Create fd_set objects for HTTPS
                Check for activity with select() for HTTP sockets
                  Set fd_set object for HTTP sockets
                Check for activity with select() for HTTPS sockets
                  Set fd_set object for HTTPS sockets
                For every HTTP client
                  Check for fd_set objects for HTTP sockets
                    Process HTTP Client
                For every HTTPS client
                  Check for fd_set objects for HTTPS sockets
                    Process HTTPS Client
            </pre>

            If you had a close eye on the control flow, you'll see insane overhead from the program creating two of everything. 
              I think that a lot of the control flow in this is correct, but I think the logic in code for HTTP and HTTPS clients
              needs to be reworked. That being said, it may works.

        <h5> Issues </h5>
        <h5>DNS Record</h5>
        <p> 
            As I've stated, I'm still a student. I live on campus and am running the server on my Raspberry Pi 3B. 
              UCSC has a crazy number of IP address so my server runs on it's own IP address currently. I'd like to buy 
              a DNS record for this server but I don't know if I'm allowed. So that being said, I've submitted the request 
              to the school. If I don't hear anything back I'll just do it - hey learning is what matters here. <br>
        </p>

        <h5>HTTPS Issues</h5>
        <p> 
            Like I've said, HTTPS may work. I can't actually test it because I need a valid certificate. I went through the Let's Encrypt 
              setup and I need a domain name. This brought me to the DNS record. Now time to wait for the school to get back to me. Once I get
              this domain, I should be able to go through Let's Encrypt to get a certificate. Then, the browser will be able to recognize the certiifcate
              and I can actually use HTTPS. We will see though if it's actually that easy. :fingers-crossed:<br>
