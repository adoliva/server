This is a project that I'm working on in my freetime outside of schoolwork. 

This project is meant to test and enhance my own skills in the world of C Sockets. I intend to update this project weekly unless stated otherwise. 
It is meant to be a simple website that serves mulitple users at once. GET, HEAD, TRACE, and OPTIONS are currently supported.

This is ALL public use although I do ask that you credit this project if you take/use any code. 

You may ask, why? Any companies that see this may just take the code and use it server-side. That's okay. Give it a few years. It'll be outdated and they'll 
  need someone to keep up with protocol design. That's where I come in. This website is meant to show my skills in protocol programming. Writing a protocol 
  is one thing, implementing an existing one is another. This program can communicate with modern web browsers on port 80 and <redacted> and will continue to.
  No need for the cloud, have the server hosted right where your headquarters are.
